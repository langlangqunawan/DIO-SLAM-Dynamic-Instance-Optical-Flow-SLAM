# DIO-SLAM-Dynamic-Instance-Optical-Flow-SLAM
We use RGBD cameras to tightly couple instance segmentation and dense optical flow methods, and propose a new dynamic SLAM method that also has dense point cloud mapping capabilities.
On the evening of July 20, 2024, the dataset processing code and actual scenario dataset will be open sourced
